Genetic Programming, is a meta-heuristic search algorithm, inspired by biological evolution,
that searches for computer programs, that can solve a defined task.

This is somewhat similar to genetic algorithms, and in fact it is!; buts its considered
a 'specialization' of genetic algorithms, with the exception being that
each member now is a computer program.

The same rules still apply, population -> selection -> crossbreeding -> repeat ...

This time around we are not looking for a computer program, where
a computer program can be defined as a set of operator and operands, usually visualized
as a tree.

But for the n-queens problem we really don't need to use a tree,
basically we start with a random solution and we look for a sequence of column-swaps
that would transform our initial solution to an optimal solution, using the least
number of swaps.

Note that we can slightly modify our solution so each program would have its own
initial random solution, this way they are all decoupled from each other and it
may be easier to run the program concurrently.
